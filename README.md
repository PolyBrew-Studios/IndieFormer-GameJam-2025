# WASD YOU THINKING?!

Meet Reginald Q. Whiskerstein III:  
Gentleman, scholar, mouse-on-a-mission.  
With a top hat snug and a questionable sense of balance,  
He pedals through peril with rodent precision.  

But beware:  
The controls are fickle.  
The road is rude.  
One bump, one blunder - you're totally screwed.  

üé© Drag to pedal.  
üåÄ Swerve with flair.  
üí• Hit a block? Back to thin air.  

A rhythm of chaos, a dance of despair,  
Yet somehow, you'll laugh as you fly through the air.  

Perfect for fans of rage, rodents, and ridiculousness.
